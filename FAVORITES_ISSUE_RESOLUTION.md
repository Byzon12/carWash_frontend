## üîß Favorites System Issue Resolution

### Problem Identified
The favorites functionality is failing because there's a mismatch between:
- **Car wash IDs** from the `/locations/` endpoint 
- **Location IDs** expected by the favorites backend system

### Error Details
```
Location.DoesNotExist: Location matching query does not exist.
```

The backend favorites system expects `Location` model IDs, but we're sending car wash IDs from a different data source.

### Immediate Solutions

#### Option 1: Backend Fix (Recommended)
Update the backend favorites system to work with car wash IDs directly:

```python
# In the favorites view (backend)
try:
    # Instead of:
    # location = Location.objects.get(id=location_id)
    
    # Use car wash data:
    carwash = CarWash.objects.get(id=location_id)  # or whatever the model is
    # Create/update favorite based on car wash data
except CarWash.DoesNotExist:
    return Response({'error': 'Car wash not found'}, status=404)
```

#### Option 2: Frontend ID Mapping
If car wash IDs need to be mapped to location IDs, add a mapping endpoint:

```python
# Backend: Add endpoint to get location ID from car wash ID
/api/carwash/{carwash_id}/location-id/
```

#### Option 3: Unified Data Model
Ensure the `/locations/` endpoint returns the correct IDs that match the `Location` model.

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Added enhanced error logging and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Location details screen shows descriptive error messages
- ‚úÖ Debug information helps identify the exact ID mismatch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Favorites functionality temporarily affected until backend is aligned

### Testing
Use the enhanced error messages to identify which specific car wash IDs are causing issues and whether they correspond to valid Location model records in the backend.

### Next Steps
1. Check backend `Location` model structure
2. Verify car wash data structure from `/locations/` endpoint
3. Align the two systems or create proper mapping
4. Update favorites API endpoints accordingly
